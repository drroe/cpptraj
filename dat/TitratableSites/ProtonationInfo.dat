# This file contains information on how to name residues
# based on calculated intrinsic pKas.
# <default state> indicates which name corresponds to the
# default state (i.e. the expected residue name before being
# changed). This will be 1 (deprotonated) for acidic residues
# and 0 (protonated) for everything else.
# <remove atom list> is an optional comma-separated list of atoms
# to remove from the residue.
# <protonated name> <deprotonated name> <default state> [<remove atom list>]
